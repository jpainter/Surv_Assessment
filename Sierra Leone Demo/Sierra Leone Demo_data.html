<!-- What would be really cool--to show number of orgunits available, assigned to dataset, and actually submitted data for each dataset/data element. -->
<p>This chart shows the percentage of active organisational units that were expected to report during each period. Any value less than 100% indicates that some organisational units were not assigned the dataset report.</p>

<p>This chart shows the perecentage of active organisational units that reported, and reported on time, during each period. Completeness is shown by level, because a report was submitted at upper levels does not indicate the percentage of reports submitted by the lower levels organisation units. <strong>Attention should be given to the lowest level, e.g. health facilities, where data is reported.</strong></p>
