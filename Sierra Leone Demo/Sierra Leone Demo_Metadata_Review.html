<li><p>There are 894 data elements, each with potential multiple option combinations (e.g. age groups)</p></li>
<li><p>Lets select some data elements using key word (or parital word) searches. A spreadsheet will be created in the data directory listing data elements with ‘malaria’, ‘ipd’, ‘attendance’, and ‘pop’.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the spreadsheet: when openned the column <strong>Include</strong> is blank. Any character in the sheet will mark the variable for inclusion.</p></li>
<li><p>Save the sheet, then run the Data_Review.Rmd file to assess the data.</p></li>

<p>NB: Future versions should aspire to having a more elegant interface for selecting variables.</p>
